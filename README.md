Schedulsine is a fast-paced, management-style cooking game where you need to run your kitchen like the CPU in a computer.
Just as the OS needs to strategically schedule jobs to run on the CPU, you will need to schedule which dishes to prepare in
order to optimize your profit and other metrics. Players will be taught about famous OS job scheduling algorithms through
actually implementing them in the context of a Gordon Ramsay-style kitchen environment. Once they have the knowledge, they
can go on to compete and see who can schedule the best.

# Basic Instructions

Navigate to the "CAREER" menu to start learning the algorithms. To schedule a ticket, simply drag it to the dark purple area
to its right. Once there you can see which ingredients you need to grab from the fridge/pantry on the left side of the kitchen!
Drag an ingredient to a station to cook it in some way (see the "HELP" menu for more info). To create the actual dish, drag a
plate to the service table under the bell. Then, drag the ingredients to it. Click the bell to serve the dish!
